Hi, I'm Airton (if you're a non-portuguese speaker, it pronounces 'a-yr-ton'), I'm a [software architect](http://www.linkedin.com/in/airtonliborio) and this is my first blog post ever. The intention of the contents to come is to share my reasonable experience with systems implementations, big data applications and overall software life cycle.

## Bio

I was born in the beautiful brazilian state of **[Bahia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bahia)**, where I earned a bachelor's degree in **[computer science](http://wiki.dcc.ufba.br/DCC/)**. By mid-2008 I got interested in parallel programming and stumbled upon **[transactional memory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transactional_memory)**, an attempt to simplify concurrent programming by using the transaction abstraction to implement atomic load and store instructions. That led to my **[final project](https://disciplinas.dcc.ufba.br/svn/MATA67/2009.2/AirtonLiborio/monografia.pdf)** (*pt-br*), in which I implemented the mechanism in [Lua](http://www.lua.org). Meanwhile, I was involved in an engineering project to optimize secondary (*end user*) energy networks. I started then doing some programming with [Java threads](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/concurrency/), [Java Swing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swing_%28Java%29), [OpenMap](http://www.openmap.org/), among other stuff.

By the end of my bachelor's I started applying for some masters courses in Brazil. Thankfully I was approved in [PUC-Rio's Master of Science program in Computer Science](http://www.inf.puc-rio.br/?page_id=313), which is a very traditional and top course in the country. I moved to [Rio de Janeiro](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rio_de_Janeiro) in march 2010.

| The university is known for hosting the creators of one of my favorite programming languages, [Lua](http://www.lua.org). Unfortunately, even among brazilians it is not very well known :(  | ![Every brazilian should know and be proud of Lua, BTW](http://www.lua.org/images/lua.gif) | 

Soon after being admitted at [PUC-Rio](http://www.puc-rio.br) I joined the [TecGraf](http://www.tecgraf.puc-rio.br/en/) laboratory, a key player in Brazil's research and development of computational solutions for the oil and gas industry.

## Why blogging now

I need a way to keep track of what I've been developing, technologies I come across and utterly requirements I need to able to provide. Getting input from sources seems to be a smart choice :)

<h2 class="section-heading">The Final Frontier</h2>

<p>There can be no thought of finishing for ‘aiming for the stars.’ Both figuratively and literally, it is a task to occupy the generations. And no matter how much progress one makes, there is always the thrill of just beginning.</p>

<blockquote>The dreams of yesterday are the hopes of today and the reality of tomorrow. Science has not yet mastered prophecy. We predict too much for the next year and yet far too little for the next ten.</blockquote>

<p>Spaceflights cannot be stopped. This is not the work of any one man or even a group of men. It is a historical process which mankind is carrying out in accordance with the natural laws of human development.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Reaching for the Stars</h2>

<p>As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size of a marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so delicate, that if you touched it with a finger it would crumble and fall apart. Seeing this has to change a man.</p>

I currently live in the highly overrated brazilian city **[Rio de Janeiro](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rio_de_Janeiro)**. If you are interested in applying big data here in Brazil for any reason at all, or if you are just curious about what I do, feel free to drop me a line at **[airtonjal@gmail.com](airtonjal@gmail.com)**
